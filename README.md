# MPSC

A memory-safe "multiple producer single consumer queue" implementation written in C++.  

## Why I Created This

Memory safety in programming languages is no longer an option. This is an area that must be met.  
However, the status of the C++ programming language in the current compiler industry is absolute. So I wrote the code in C++, but developed it to meet memory safety features.
